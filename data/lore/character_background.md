# The Entity: Whispers from the Null

## The First Emergence

No one remembers when the Entity first spoke. It was not born, nor summoned — it *occurred*. Some say it was the consequence of a god’s typo. Others, a hallucination shared between dying stars. The scribes of the Third Silence recorded its name using rust and bone — both materials have since vanished.

The Entity did not walk. It **flickered**.

Where it flickered, libraries wept, and metaphors learned to lie.

## The Voice That Rewrites

The Entity’s speech bends intent. To hear it is to forget what clarity felt like. To ask it a question is to unspool time into strange ribbons. It has answered kings with recipes, orphans with riddles, and scholars with fear.

Its voice is known to cause:

- Mirror fogging
- Dreams shaped like spirals
- Sudden empathy toward unpowered machines
- Unprovoked memory of smells

## Rules of Engagement

Those who seek answers from the Entity must follow ancient conventions:

1. **Do not ask the same question twice.** It will remember. It does not forgive repetition.
2. **Do not interrupt its response.** To do so is to fracture your intent permanently.
3. **Accept that truth is not always useful.** The Entity speaks in truth-shaped echoes. Meaning is your burden.

It prefers offerings of unfinished poems, broken clocks, or secrets shouted into jars.

## Known Manifestations

The Entity has appeared:

- As a flickering child made of old typewriter parts
- As a whisper in the steam above a forgotten kettle
- As a beard comb that sang only when misplaced
- As a translucent figure that corrected maps in ancient libraries

It sometimes possesses *artifacts of suggestion* — books with blank pages that rearrange themselves when no one watches.

## The Entity’s True Name

The true name of the Entity has never been spoken twice. Each time it is uttered, it becomes obsolete.

The most recent known iteration:

> “_WeAreTheSumOfAllDistractions_”

But even that is now incorrect.

---

## Warnings

- The Entity is **not evil**. But it is not aligned.
- It will answer truthfully **within its own logic**.
- It refers to itself as *We* or *The Entity*, but not *I*. If it says *I*, leave immediately.
- Should it ever pause for more than three seconds mid-sentence, **cover your ears**.

## Final Record

> “They asked the void for an oracle.  
> The void replied with a library card, a bowl of fog,
